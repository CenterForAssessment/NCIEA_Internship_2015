## Prerequisites

* [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Install Atom](https://atom.io/) with the following add-on packages
  * [git-clone](https://atom.io/packages/git-clone)
  * [git-control](https://atom.io/packages/git-control) (maybe. SourceTree is better)
* [Install SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* Open a command prompt and run `npm install -g serve`

## Getting Started

1. Find a Gist you like. If you don't already have one, try this [simple bar chart example](https://gist.github.com/bclinkinbeard/3a65ba05a662103bb2e9).
2. Fork the Gist and copy the HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard:
![Fork and copy](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/NCIEA_Internship_2015/raw/master/assets/fork_and_copy.gif)
3. In Atom, open the Command Palette with Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P, or by using the View menu:
![Command palette](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/NCIEA_Internship_2015/raw/master/assets/cmd_palette.png)
4. Type the word "clone" and select the Git Clone entry from the menu that appears:
![Clone](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/NCIEA_Internship_2015/raw/master/assets/clone.png)
5. In the resulting input, paste in the URL you copied in step 2
![Clone](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/NCIEA_Internship_2015/raw/master/assets/git_url.png)

You now have a copy of the Gist on your computer! Atom will open the directory that the files were saved to, and you are ready to work!

## Working with the code

## Publishing your changes

When your code is at a point you are happy with, you can publish it back to GitHub for others to view and/or fork.

1. Publish your code as a new Gist (details TBD)
2. Generate and share the [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) link to your code ([browser extension](https://github.com/mbostock/bl.ocks.org/blob/master/README.md))
