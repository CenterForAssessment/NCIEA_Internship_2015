Ideas for Assessment Literacy Modules
=====================================

## Damian

- The irrelevance of vertical/interval scaling for growth interpretation.

## Gretchen
 - [ ] ~~building a test from a blueprint~~
 - [ ] Interpreting Test Scores
 - *  Raw score, percent correct, and inference about domain mastery
 - *  Scale score and relationship with raw. Redirect to Equivalence module for specific use example. 
 - *  Performance categories and relationship to score
 - *  Interpreting indvidual to peer performance
 - *  Using scores to answer specific questions
 - **  Of the information in this lesson, what information would you use to answer these questions? 
 - ***  How many items did my child get right out of total? 
 - ***  Did my child meet the standards for 6th grade math?
 - ***  How did my child do in comparison to her peers?


## Luciana

Following the NCME RFP suggestions, the following topic/sub-topics seem to be good canditates for Explorable Explanation modules:

- Understanding the Results of Testing/Assessment
	- Understanding Normative Interpretations
	- Understanding Criterion-referenced Interpretations
	- Equivalence of Test Scores (Equating)
	- Scoring (not in the RFP, but seems relevant)
