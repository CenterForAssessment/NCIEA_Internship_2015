Ideas for Assessment Literacy Modules
=====================================

## Damian

- The irrelevance of vertical/interval scaling for growth interpretation.

## Gretchen
 - [ ] ~~building a test from a blueprint~~
 - [ ] ~~Interpreting Test Scores~~
 - [ ] Interpreting Scale Scores
 - [ ] Audience: non-technical adult
 -   Raw score, percent correct, and inference about domain mastery (activity: enter raw score to get % correct and a graphic of domain mastery)
 -   Scale score(s) and relationship to raw.
 -   	* types of scale scores, interpretation and uses

## Luciana

Following the NCME RFP suggestions, the following topic/sub-topics seem to be good canditates for Explorable Explanation modules:

- Understanding the Results of Testing/Assessment
	- Understanding Normative Interpretations
	- Understanding Criterion-referenced Interpretations
	- Equivalence of Test Scores (Equating)
	- Scoring (not in the RFP, but seems relevant)
