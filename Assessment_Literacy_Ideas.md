Ideas for Assessment Literacy Modules
=====================================

## Damian

- The irrelevance of vertical/interval scaling for growth interpretation.

## Gretchen
 - [ ] ~~building a test from a blueprint~~
 - [ ] Interpreting Test Scores
 - [ ] Audience: non-technical adult
 -   Raw score, percent correct, and inference about domain mastery (activity: enter raw score to get % correct and a graphic of domain mastery)
 -   Scale score and relationship with raw. Redirect to Equivalence module for specific use example. (actvity: change scale of Raw score, observe there is no change in % correct or domain mastery graphic)
 -   Performance categories and relationship to score (activity: change raw score to change performance cat assignment)
 -   Interpreting indvidual to peer performance (actvitiy: change raw score to change comparitive info)
 -   Using scores to answer specific questions
 	 * Final activity: Of the information in this lesson, what information would you use to answer these questions? 
 		* How many items did my child get right out of total? 
 		* Did my child meet the standards for 6th grade math?
   	 	* How did my child do in comparison to her peers?


## Luciana

Following the NCME RFP suggestions, the following topic/sub-topics seem to be good canditates for Explorable Explanation modules:

- Understanding the Results of Testing/Assessment
	- Understanding Normative Interpretations
	- Understanding Criterion-referenced Interpretations
	- Equivalence of Test Scores (Equating)
	- Scoring (not in the RFP, but seems relevant)
