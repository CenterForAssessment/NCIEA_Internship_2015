Ideas for Assessment Literacy Modules
=====================================

## Damian

- The irrelevance of vertical/interval scaling for growth interpretation.

## Gretchen
 - [ ] building a test from a blueprint


## Luciana

Following the NCME RFP suggestions, the following topic/sub-topics seem to be good canditates for Explorable Explanation modules:

- Understanding the Results of Testing/Assessment
	- Understanding Normative Interpretations
	- Understanding Criterion-referenced Interpretations
	- Equivalence of Test Scores (Equating)
	- Scoring (not in the RFP, but seems relevant)
